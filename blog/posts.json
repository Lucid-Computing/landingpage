      "content": "<h2>Introduction: The Gap Between Policy Assumptions and Technical Reality</h2><p>In his July 30, 2025 address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios outlined the Trump Administration's approach to AI export control enforcement. While acknowledging resource constraints at the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Kratsios expressed confidence that physical chip tracking presents manageable challenges, characterizing AI hardware as \"massive racks that are tons in weight\" that are difficult to relocate and easy to monitor—implying that simple physical inspections could suffice.</p>"

On one side, Congressional leaders are calling for stricter export controls—House Select Committee Chairman John Moolenaar's recent letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick outlines eight specific requirements for limiting AI diffusion while maintaining security. On the other side, OpenAI's launch of \"OpenAI for Countries\" signals the industry's push for aggressive global expansion.</p>"

Enabling Bilateral Dealmaking Through AI Chip Access</h3><p>AI is becoming the most economically powerful technology in history. The administration has a unique opportunity: controlling who gets access to U.S.-made AI chips can become one of its strongest tools in global trade negotiations.</p>"
