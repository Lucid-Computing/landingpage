      "content": "<h2>Four Essential Properties of an America First AI Trade Policy</h2><p>From the Administration's perspective, an effective America First approach to AI trade policy should accomplish four critical objectives: Enable bilateral dealmaking leveraging America's AI chip advantage, ensure global competitiveness of U.S. semiconductor manufacturers, maintain the hardware edge for U.S.-based AI companies, and prevent adversarial use of U.S. technology in weapons development and other security threats.</p><h3>1. Enabling Bilateral Dealmaking Through AI Chip Access</h3><p>AI is becoming the most economically powerful technology in history. The administration has a unique opportunity: controlling who gets access to U.S.-made AI chips can become one of its strongest tools in global trade negotiations.</p>"
